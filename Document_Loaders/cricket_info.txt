Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each. 
It originated in England and is now popular worldwide, especially in countries like India, Australia, 
England, Pakistan, and South Africa.

The game is played on a circular or oval field, with a 22-yard pitch at the center. 
Each team takes turns batting and bowling/fielding. 
The batting side aims to score runs, while the bowling/fielding side tries to dismiss the batsmen.

There are different formats of cricket:
1. Test Cricket – The longest format, lasting up to 5 days.
2. One Day Internationals (ODIs) – Each team faces a fixed number of overs, usually 50.
3. Twenty20 (T20) – A shorter format with 20 overs per side.

Famous cricketers include Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Don Bradman, M.S. Dhoni, and Brian Lara.

Cricket is known not just for its competition but also for its spirit of sportsmanship and tradition.
